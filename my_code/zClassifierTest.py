This is an example of program that tests the Iris challenge Classifier class.
Another style is to incorporate the test as a main function in the Data manager class itself,
but having both is not incompatible (a smaller test with the program and a more developped use case here).

This module could perform hyper-parameter selection by cross-validation
See: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html.
